= Losses Due to Insolvency of Licensed US Financial Institutions

At present, the exact status of customers' lost funds is unclear.


In order to substantiate a loss, there must be no reasonable prospect of recovery (and no other compensation by insurance or otherwise).

The FTX US terms of service explicitly stated that they do not take title to customer funds. On the other hand, Celsius' terms of service did claim title to customer deposits.    

The current best case scenario for retail investors is that the bankruptcy court finds the stolen funds to be the customers' property, effectively placing them first in line despite the extended disruption of their ownership.

If the stolen funds are deemed property of the bankruptcy estate, customers would become unsecured creditors, entitled only to a pro rata share of what remains after secured creditors are paid out.#mk_footnote("not_your_keys")

Once an entity files for bankruptcy, the law simply points those with lost funds toward the inky blackness of bankruptcy law, and taxpayers are effectively stuck in limbo.

Must be illegal in the jurisdiction it occurred and  done with criminal intent.#mk_footnote("rr_72-112")

Currently, it is unclear where exactly the theft and/or embezzlement of user funds will be deemed to have taken place legally, and therefore what the pertinent law is.

We do know however that the definition of "theft" set out in Treas. Reg. § 1.165-8 includes embezzlement. According to noted disaster whisperer John Jay Ray III, the implosion of FTX was due in whole or in part to "old fashion embezzlement". 

Conviction is not required#mk_footnote("vietzke");  (but taxpayers aren't generally going to be able to litigate this themselves if litigation also requires proof in such a complex case)

Theft losses are treated as sustained during the year the taxpayer discovers the loss, as opposed to when the loss actually occurs.13 Further, a theft loss can only be taken when there is no “reasonable prospect of recovery” and when it can be “ascertained with reasonable certainty that no recovery or reimbursement will be received with respect to the stolen property.”14; Treas. Reg. § 1.165-1(d)(2).

"What constitutes a reasonable prospect of recovery is a question of fact. Nonetheless, a good legal adviser must take into account that having a claim for reimbursement may spoil a theft loss claim.15 Widely experienced losses may lead to special arrangements.  Due to the outcry from wealthy individuals following the widespread investment fraud that swept the country during the Great Recession, Treasury and the Service provided a truncated procedure for determining when certain investment losses could be taken.16"

Madoff: December 15, 2008 bankruptcy trustee appointed/case begins
June 2009, IRS issues safe harbor guidelines in 2009-20.

In the aggregate, there's no satisfactory answer to this because of the complexity of dealing with the bankruptcy estate, the associated property rights issues, and the theft issue.

Along with FTX, crypto lenders Celsius, Voyager Digital, BlockFi, and Genesis Global Capital, as well as hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), all collapsed, leaving investors—from small traders to financial institutions—at the mercy of bankruptcy proceedings. 

My proposal is the "retail investor protection procedure of 2023": Taxpayers who received a "net positive account balance" letter from the bankruptcy estate can claim a binary capital loss of \$6,000 or they can continue into the bankruptcy proceedings and take their changes. Beyond the \$6,000 they keep going into recover, and if there's anything left over and they've already taken the loss, the excess just gets distributed pro rata to the nation's public education system.

There are complex issues of ownership and recovery involved in the actual property rights surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings.

For taxpayers who were also customers of FTX, they've probably received a letter from the bankruptcy estate, but the average person's most recent memories of this are probably getting their thirty-two cent check from the equifax breach settlement, or getting eleven dollars back from their health insurance company for a medical loss ratio rebate (if they have health insurance).

It would be nice to see the government trying to help these people with less worry for these minutae, because however you feel about this, they were allegedly the victims of a crime. The status quo feels like the government hiding the ball from taxpayers. At the end of the day, the IRS is going to be the entity decidihng whether it's going to allow or disallow these claims.

For tax purposes, the main question is when and how taxpayers can actually claim a loss. The problem with the Madoff safe harbor was three-fold, but the main one is that it created a difficult to manage stretched-out regime having to deal with amendments for clawbacks/recoveries.

We know that there were significant accounting and bookkeeping problems with FTX, and it seems likely that in the digital currency context, institutional failures will have similar problems, which has implications relative to the bankruptcy proceedings.

I think the not your keys paper mentioned that at least in the case of Celsius, the terms of service were respected by the bankruptcy court.

As soon as the depositor institution becomes insolvent and files for bankruptcy, taxpayers are hurled toward the event horizon of the inky blackness that is bankruptcy law.

Even bankruptcy experts are not sure how to treat this scenario.

What we do know is that the average retail depositor is an unsecured creditor.

The current standard of "reasonable prospect of recovery" is unmanageable for retail investors. For licensed institutions which subsequently declare bankruptcy, the moment the shroud of bankrupcty law covers the stage, the average person has effectively suffered a loss.

Particularly in the case of FTX.

The IRS isn't exactly flush with political capital right now; call it the "retail investor protection program of 2023" or something.

Small holders who are now unsecured creditors in the FTX bankruptcy estate are entitled to a pro rata share of whatever is left over after secured creditors are paid out. From what we know about the activities and finances of FTX based on reporting and sworn statements by John Jay Ray, unsecured creditors will probably recover nothing.

Allow investors to claim a "safe harbor" allowing a capital loss of \$3,000 or \$5,000.

The factors from the Madoff stuff;

For a retail investor aid program, you wouldn't have the complex reporting issues that were present with the safe-harbor provision about backdating and updating, and you wouldn't have to allow ordinary losses.


Instead, bankruptcy courts might well deem the custodial holdings to be property of the bankrupt exchange, rather than of its customers. If so, the customers would merely be general unsecured creditors of the exchange, entitled only to a pro rata distribution of the exchange’s residual assets after any secured or priority creditors had been repaid. (not your keys, p. 1)

If there are any concerns about the accuracy of the estate’s books and
records or if the estate lacks sufficient cryptocurrency holdings to
satisfy all customer obligations, then the stay is unlikely to be lifted,
even if the estate’s interest is merely possessory. (not your keys p. 53)
Similarly, if the debtor’s books and records do not accurately reflect
the estate’s actual cryptocurrency holdings, the court might be chary
of releasing any cryptocurrency holdings lest it turn into a first-come, first-serve situation that results in an inequitable distribution among
customers who could not prove what they individually were owed.

"shortfalls in custodial holdings":
Property can only be property of the estate of if it exists,
however. If any part of a customer’s holdings of cryptocurrency have
been lost—it has have been stolen in a hack, the exchange has lost the
private key,175 or the exchange has used and lost the cryptocurrency in
its own business dealings—then the customer is merely an unsecured
creditor of the exchange for the missing holdings176 and there would
be no cause for lifting the automatic stay.

If any additional factors are involved—inaccurate books and
records, shortfalls in custodial holdings, or exchange use of custodial
holdings, then a court would be likely to rule that the custodially held
cryptocurrency was property of the estate, so the automatic stay would
prevent attempts to recover it outside of the bankruptcy process. At
the very least, the estate accedes to the exchange’s possessory interest
in the private keys. That alone should trigger the automatic stay (p. 55)

. How any particular bankruptcy court
would characterize custodial holdings of cryptocurrency in light of the
particular facts before it is uncertain and sure to be contested. That
alone should be cause for concern to cryptocurrency investors. Even
if the investors were to ultimately prevail, it would not be until after
drawn out litigation with all of the attendant delays and costs. (p. 55)

The unsecured creditors are
essentially at the back of the distribution line, ahead of only equity
holders and any subordinated creditors. They are likely to get paid little,
if anything, and payment might not be for quite a while.

To the extent that there are no funds remaining, a creditor’s
claim will simply not be paid. If the debtor is liquidating, that is the
end of the matter, while if the debtor is reorganizing in Chapter 11, the
unpaid debts will be discharged, which means that a permanent federal
injunction prohibits attempts to collect them.207
If a cryptocurrency exchange’s customers are just general
unsecured creditors in regards of their custodial holdings, they would
rank at the bottom for repayment priority and could expect to see
recoveries of far less than par in an exchange’s bankruptcy. The one
possible boon for them is that if the estate continues to hold onto the
cryptocurrency during the bankruptcy and it appreciates, they will
potentially be able to share in the appreciation, but that will be only
after all priority creditors are paid in full.208 In short, if cryptocurrency
exchange customers are just unsecured creditors, then bankruptcy is
likely to be an unhappy outcome for them. (p. 60)

erely general unsecured creditors of the exchange, meaning that they
would have a “claim”—a right to payment—in the bankruptcy. (p. 59)

The FTX terms of service stated they did not take title to any transferred assets.
