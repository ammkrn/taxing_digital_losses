== Son of _Pilgrim's Pride_


In the case _Pilgrim's Pride Corp. v. Commissioner_, Pilgrim's Pride abandoned preferred stock which had significantly decreased in value; the board concluded that the tax benefit provided by abandonment was preferrable to a sale and the accompanying capital losses. Gold Kist (later acquired by Pilgrim's Pride) abandoned the devalued securities by sending them to their bank along with a letter stating that Gold Kist "irrevocably abandons, relinquishes, and surrenders all of its rights, title and interest" in the securities. Gold Kist reported the abandonment loss on their 2004 tax return.#mk_footnote("pilgrims_pride")

Pilgrim's Pride (Gold Kist's acquirer) filed for bankruptcy five years later, and was issued a deficiency notice with respect to their 2004 return; the IRS asserted that the abandonment was a capital loss, as the abandonment effectively fell under the § 165(g) worthless securities provision. The tax court sua sponte asked for additional briefing on the application of § 1234A. Pilgrim's Pride lost in tax court, but the Fifth Circuit reversed, permitting Pilgrim's Pride to take ordinary losses.#mk_footnote("pilgrims_pride") With respect to § 1234A, which became the issue of primary interest in litigation, the Fifth Circuit's opinion took a strict approach to statutory interpretation:

#block_quote()[
The abandonment of a capital asset for no consideration is not a "sale or exchange," as that term is used in § 165(f). _See Echols v. Comm'r_, 935 F.2d 703 , 707 (5th Cir. 1991) (approving ordinary loss treatment for abandonment of partnership interest); _see also Citron v. Comm'r_, 97 T.C. 200 , 215 (1991) ("'The touchstone for sale or exchange treatment is consideration.'" (quoting _La Rue v. Comm'r_, 90 T.C. 465 , 483 (1988))). However, the Tax Code contains numerous provisions directing that certain transactions be treated as if they were sales or exchanges.#mk_footnote("pilgrims_pride")

[..]

One such provision is § 1234A, which requires capital loss treatment for any loss "attributable to the cancellation, lapse, expiration, or other termination of -- (1) a right or obligation . . . with respect to property which is (or on acquisition would be) a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer." 26 U.S.C. § 1234A(1) .

[...]

The primary question in this case is whether § 1234A(1) applies to a taxpayer's abandonment of a capital asset. The answer is no. By its plain terms, § 1234A(1) applies to the termination of rights or obligations with respect to capital assets (e.g. derivative or contractual rights to buy or sell capital assets). It does not apply to the termination of ownership of the capital asset itself. Applied to the facts of this case, Pilgrim's Pride abandoned the Securities, not a "right or obligation . . . with respect to" the Securities. 26 U.S.C. § 1234A(1).#mk_footnote("pilgrims_pride")

The taxpayer's victory in Pilgrim's Pride was short-lived. A footnote in the opinion reveals that "Treasury Regulation § 1.165-5(i), issued in 2007, [..] prospectively adopts an interpretation of 26 U.S.C. § 165(g) that an abandoned security is per se "worthless" and therefore any resulting loss is capital. #mk_footnote("pilgrims_pride") Pilgrim's Pride's abandonment appeared on their 2004 return, § 1.165-5(i) was adopted in 2007, and the IRS initially issued their deficiency in 2009, meaning that Pilgrim's Pride executed their abandonment within a window where this tax maneuver was permitted, but the window was closed by the time the Fifth Circuit decided the case.

However, considering Notice 2014-12, the reasoning set out in _Pilgrim's Pride_, and Chief Counsel Memorandum 202302011, a properly executed abandonment of devalued digital assets would seem to qualify for ordinary losses, permitting the kind of hedge § 1.165-5(i) seeks to prevent (capital gains and ordinary losses).

The most effective solution is to modify § 165(g) by adding "and digital assets as defined in § 6045(g)(3)(D)" where appropriate, and Treas. Reg. § 1.165-5(i) to include abandonment of digital assets, such that abandoned digital assets are considered per se worthless, restricting the taxpayer to capital losses.
