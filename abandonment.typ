= Abandonment of Digital Assets

Treas. Reg. § 1.165-2 permits taxpayers to claim a deduction under § 165(a) for "[a] loss incurred in a business or in a transaction entered into for profit and arising from the sudden termination of the usefulness in such business or transaction of any nondepreciable property, in a case where such business or transaction is discontinued or where such property is permanently discarded from use therein".#mk_footnote("165-2")

Chief Counsel's Memorandum 202302011 expresses the following relevant opinions relevant to abandonment losses in the context of digital assets:#mk_footnote("chief_counsel_memorandum")

1. § 165(g) (worthless securities) does not apply to digital assets purchased on an exchange for personal investment purposes, because Notice 2014-21 directs taxpayers to treat digital assets as property. The memorandum takes a plain-language interpretation of § 165(g)(2), implying cryptocurrency generally does not fall within § 165(g).
2. digital assets are not worthless if the owner is capable of deriving value from their disposition in the future (even if they are trading at less than a fraction of a cent).
3. "abandonment" can be shown as follows:

#block_quote()[
Abandonment is proven through an evaluation of the surrounding facts and circumstances, which must show: (1) an intention to abandon the property, coupled with (2) an affirmative act of abandonment. _See Massey-Ferguson, Inc. v. Commissioner_, 59 T.C. 220, 225 (1972) (citing _Boston Elevated Railway Co. v. Commissioner_, 16 T.C. 1084, 1108 (1951), aff’d, 196 F.2d 923 (1st Cir. 1952)).

Digital assets may be affirmatively abandoned by intentionally transferring them to an unspendable address (see @unspendable). Legal recognition of such an act as abandonment by tax authorities is an open question; the abandoning party may need to call an expert witness, but if this matter were to become the subject of litigation there would eventually be little doubt that such a transfer does indeed constitute irrevocable abandonment, after which the taxpayer can no longer exercise dominion or control over the transferred assets.

Because digital assets are treated as property and are generally obtained in a transaction entered into for profit, holders of digital assets may be able to execute a "dealer's choice" to obtain a significant tax advantag by taking capital gains treatment if their holdings appreciate, but ordinary losses if their holdings significantly decrease invalue to the point that an ordinary loss is more advantageous than capital losses plus the sale proceeds. Flash devaluations into this 'abandonment goldilocks zone' are common events in the digital asset market; meme coins, rug-pulls, and large scale security disasters are normal events in the digital asset ecosystem.

Overall, this strategy is problematic from a tax policy perspective because it inadvertently rewards taxpayers who make particularly poor investment decisions.
